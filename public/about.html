<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>Tech has always been a huge passion of mine for as long as I can remember. I would always get into so much trouble. Whether it be installing a different operating system on my parents computer because I was grounded and they wouldn't give me the password - To my curiosity of botnets and learning all about them at my old public library. I do not condone attempting to hone your botnet skills at a public library. Trust me, it doesn't end well.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like to learn new things of interest. I try to commit to learning at least one new fact a day, whether it's about politics, health, science, tech, sports, you name it. This is a way that I can keep my brain active and protect it from rotting away. I also enjoy endulging in video games with friends; watching online friends livestream on Twitch; learning new money making methods; and of course staying active in public forums and Discord servers to keep up my presence.</p>

<p>For the longest time, I've wanted to create programs that will simplify day to day activities online. Whether for business or leisure. To master the art of walking, one must learn to crawl first. Trust me, this is an important process. I've attempted to skip the crawling phase. It just doesn't work. I turned my attention to online courses and bootcamps. My ultimate goal is to take a coding bootcamp and get a certificate of completion. That's one giant leap towards reeling in the big bucks. Until then, I've started a course on Udemy, taught by Dr. Angela Yu. This course is on Web Development. I've realized web development clicks with me so much. I'm enjoying this journey, and I can't wait to be able to share all of my skills with potential clients and employers!</p>
